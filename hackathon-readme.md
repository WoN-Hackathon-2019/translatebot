### Hackathon Goals

First of all: thank you for your interest in testing our technology and lending us your time.

With this test we want to show that it is possible to install and run a simple WoN bot with a few commands. Starting to hack it is then only a matter of getting a Java IDE configured.

You'll run a bot that connects to our [hackathon instance](https://hackathon.matchat.org/) and reacts to [every new atom that is created](https://hackathon.matchat.org/owner/#!/create). 

To get started, follow the instructions on https://github.com/researchstudio-sat/bot-skeleton

### Goals

1. Setup the framework
2. Start the bot
3. Create an atom and get connected with your bot at: https://hackathon.matchat.org

### Advanced goals

4. Instead of an echo, let the bot send a fortune cookie message
5. Only react to a specific type of atoms, like CyclingInterests

Questions and feedback are explicity welcome: just create an Issue in this project!
